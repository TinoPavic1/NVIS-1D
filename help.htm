<h1>HF Radio Propagation Modes</h1>
<p>Line of Sight (LOS) range is limited by terrain, most often to 2-10km.</p>
<p>Ground Wave (GW) range is limited by terrain and ground conductivity to 10-60km.</p>
<p>GW over salt water has 8,000 km range.</p>
<p>SkyWave (SW) uses reflection from Ionosphere and covers entire Earth.</p>
<p>NVIS uses reflection from Ionosphere and covers 0-600 km range.</p>
<p>Ionosphere changes all the time, and optimal frequencies change with it.</p>
<p>Any HF link using only one frequency will keep fading in and out!</p>
<p>NVIS needs 2 frequencies: day and night. Extended range NVIS needs 1 more for noon/extended .</p>
<p>NVIS is effective from almost any antenna site.</p>
<p>SkyWave covers much longer distances than NVIS, but most antenna sites are not suitable.</p>
<p>Obstacles and terrain often block low elevation angles used for Skywave.</p>

<h2>Link setup (row 1)</h2>
<p>View Select -options are: table, SNR plot, Skip plot, SLM plot or help</p>
<p>......... View Table - detailed link data in table</p>
<p>......... View SNR - plots signal to noise ratio traces</p>
<p>......... View Skip - plots skip zone versus frequency</p>
<p>......... View SLM - plots secant law multiplier versus elevation angle</p>
<p>State – Australian state, latitude.</p>
<p>Month –season of the year.</p>
<p>Year –sunspot cycle progression</p>
<p>hF2 - layer F2 height above ground</p>
<p>Dist –terrestrial link distance</p>

<h2>Transmiter setup (row 2)</h2>
<p>Tx Ant – select transmit antenna type</p>
<p>Mast –transmit antenna height</p>
<p>Power – transmit power</p>
<p>EL – minimum elevation angle for antenna site</p>
<p>Grx – receive antenna gain use (off, on, avg)</p>
<p>............Grx-off assumes gain Grx = 0 dB</p>
<p>............Grx-on  uses gain Grx</p>
<p>............Grx-Avg– uses gain Grx - Grx average</p>
<p>HF receiver noise floor is under -130 dBm, while noise on lower HF is 30 dB higher.</p>
<p>Rx antenna with 30 dB loss has both noise and signal attenuated, but SNR stays the same.</p>
<p>Setting Grx-Avg takes this into account, and should be used with short Rx antennas.</p>

<h2>Receiver setup (row 3)</h2>
<p>Rx Ant – select receive antenna type</p>
<p>Mast –transmit antenna height</p>
<p>Location – rural, suburban, city</p>
<p>Weather – storms affect NVIS</p>
